We only invest in crypto at the moment, and specifically only in tokens with actual utility.
<br/><br/>
Governance is not utility, neither is revenue generation.
<br/><br/>
To have utility, the protocol has to be built around the token, instead of the other way around. Only very few tokens fit that architecture.
